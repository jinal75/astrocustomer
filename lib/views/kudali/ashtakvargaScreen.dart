These are basically a point system where each planet except Rahu and Ketu are allotted a specific number in a specific house of your Kundali or birth chart. The higher number denotes the strength of that house in your Kundali. For example, if you have a higher value in the 11th house, which is the house of income, that would be a good sign as the planets in that house have a strong position and influence your Kundali more than others. For that reason, many believe Ashtakavarga in astrology to be even more precise than the birth chart or Janam Kundali analysis.',
